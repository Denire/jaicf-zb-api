# JAICF Kotlin External
This repo will contain modules and examples with mixed functionality, which won't be added to github.

### jaicf-zb-api module
Provides a module which uses ZB API for reactions for any channel. It means that it will work in any channel, even if it's not supported by JAICF.

Works with polling/webhook connections. See examples [here](https://bitbucket.org/just-ai/jaicf-kotlin-external/src/master/examples/jaicf-zb-api-example/src/main/kotlin/example/connections/).
